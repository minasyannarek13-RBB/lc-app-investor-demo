# LC App Execution State

Date: 2026-08-30
Milestone: LC App External Review MVP
Current status: READY FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW

## Locked Baseline
- Social MVP live E2E confirmed by founder report: 21/21 PASS, 0 failures/blockers.
- Production commit verified by QA: `71fd452`.
- QA commit verified by QA: `f2c641c`.

## Last Completed Work
- Root `index.html` restored to the real LC App shell instead of redirect-only showcase entry.

- `auth.js` now accepts `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from `window.LC_APP_CONFIG`.
- `social.js` is included in the real app shell and service worker cache list.
- Service worker cache bumped to `lc-app-investor-demo-v52`.
- HTML/JS/CSS requests are network-first with cache fallback to avoid stale review builds.
- Social module now clears on logout.
- Search results now support opening a public profile view.
- Public profile view shows profile data, follower/following counts, recent posts, follow/block/report actions.
- Profile reporting added for user-behavior review surface.
